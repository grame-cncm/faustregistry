## Dynamic


----

### `(ef.)cubicnl`

Cubic nonlinearity distortion.
`cubicnl` is a standard Faust function.

#### Usage:

```
_ : cubicnl(drive,offset) : _
_ : cubicnl_nodc(drive,offset) : _
```

Where:

* `drive`: distortion amount, between 0 and 1
* `offset`: constant added before nonlinearity to give even harmonics. Note: offset
   can introduce a nonzero mean - feed cubicnl output to dcblocker to remove this.

### `(ef.)stereo_width`

Stereo Width effect using the Blumlein Shuffler technique.
`stereo_width` is a standard Faust function.

#### Usage

At `w=0`, the output signal is mono ((left+right)/2 in both channels).
At `w=1`, there is no effect (original stereo image).
Thus, w between 0 and 1 varies stereo width from 0 to "original".

### `(ef.)mesh_square`

Square Rectangular Digital Waveguide Mesh.

#### Usage

```
bus(4*N) : mesh_square(N) : bus(4*N)
```

Where:

* `N`: number of nodes along each edge - a power of two (1,2,4,8,...)

#### Reference

* [https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Digital_Waveguide_Mesh.html](https://ccrma.stanford.edu/~jos/pasp/Digital_Waveguide_Mesh.html)

#### Signal Order In and Out

The mesh is constructed recursively using 2x2 embeddings. Thus,
the top level of `mesh_square(M)` is a block 2x2 mesh, where each
block is a `mesh(M/2)`. Let these blocks be numbered 1,2,3,4 in the
geometry NW,NE,SW,SE, i.e., as:

        1 2
        3 4

Each block has four vector inputs and four vector outputs, where the
length of each vector is `M/2`. Label the input vectors as Ni,Ei,Wi,Si,
i.e., as the inputs from the North, East South, and West,
and similarly for the outputs. Then, for example, the upper
left input block of M/2 signals is labeled 1Ni. Most of the
connections are internal, such as 1Eo -> 2Wi. The `8*(M/2)` input
signals are grouped in the order:

       1Ni 2Ni
       3Si 4Si
       1Wi 3Wi
       2Ei 4Ei

and the output signals are:

       1No 1Wo
       2No 2Eo
       3So 3Wo
       4So 4Eo
or:

       In: 1No 1Wo 2No 2Eo 3So 3Wo 4So 4Eo
       Out: 1Ni 2Ni 3Si 4Si 1Wi 3Wi 2Ei 4Ei

Thus, the inputs are grouped by direction N,S,W,E, while the
outputs are grouped by block number 1,2,3,4, which can also be
interpreted as directions NW, NE, SW, SE.  A simple program
illustrating these orderings is `process = mesh_square(2);`.

#### Example

Reflectively terminated mesh impulsed at one corner:

```
mesh_square_test(N,x) = mesh_square(N)~(busi(4*N,x)) // input to corner
with { 
    busi(N,x) = bus(N) : par(i,N,*(-1)) : par(i,N-1,_), +(x); 
};
process = 1-1' : mesh_square_test(4); // all modes excited forever
```

In this simple example, the mesh edges are connected as follows:

       1No -> 1Ni, 1Wo -> 2Ni, 2No -> 3Si, 2Eo -> 4Si,
       3So -> 1Wi, 3Wo -> 3Wi, 4So -> 2Ei, 4Eo -> 4Ei

A routing matrix can be used to obtain other connection geometries.
