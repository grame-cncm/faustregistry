#  webaudio.lib 


This library implement WebAudio filters, using their C++ version as a starting point, 
taken from Mozilla Firefox implementation.

### `(wa.)lowpass2`

Standard second-order resonant lowpass filter with 12dB/octave rolloff.
Frequencies below the cutoff pass through, frequencies above it are attenuated.

#### Usage

```
_ : lowpass2(f0, Q, dtune) : _
```

Where:

* `f0`: cutoff frequency in Hz
* `Q`: the quality factor
* `dtune`: detuning of the frequency in cents

### `(wa.)highpass2`

Standard second-order resonant highpass filter with 12dB/octave rolloff.
Frequencies below the cutoff are attenuated, frequencies above it pass through.

#### Usage

```
_ : highpass2(f0, Q, dtune) : _
```

Where:

* `f0`: cutoff frequency in Hz
* `Q`: the quality factor
* `dtune`: detuning of the frequency in cents

----

### `(wa.)bandpass2`

Standard second-order bandpass filter.
Frequencies outside the given range of frequencies are attenuated, the frequencies inside it pass through.

#### Usage

```
_ : bandpass2(f0, Q, dtune) : _
```

Where:

* `f0`: cutoff frequency in Hz
* `Q`: the quality factor
* `dtune`: detuning of the frequency in cents

----

### `(wa.)notch2`

Standard notch filter, also called a band-stop or band-rejection filter.
It is the opposite of a bandpass filter: frequencies outside the give range of frequencies 
pass through, frequencies inside it are attenuated.

#### Usage

```
_ : notch2(f0, Q, dtune) : _
```

Where:

* `f0`: cutoff frequency in Hz
* `Q`: the quality factor
* `dtune`: detuning of the frequency in cents

----

### `(wa.)allpass2`

Standard second-order allpass filter. It lets all frequencies through,
but changes the phase-relationship between the various frequencies.

#### Usage

```
_ : allpass2(f0, Q, dtune) : _
```

Where:

* `f0`: cutoff frequency in Hz
* `Q`: the quality factor
* `dtune`: detuning of the frequency in cents

----

### `(wa.)peaking2`

Frequencies inside the range get a boost or an attenuation, frequencies outside it are unchanged.

#### Usage

```
_ : peaking2(f0, gain, Q, dtune) : _
```

Where:

* `f0`: cutoff frequency in Hz
* `gain`: the gain in dB
* `Q`: the quality factor
* `dtune`: detuning of the frequency in cents

#### Reference

* [https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/webaudio/blink/Biquad.cpp#233](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/webaudio/blink/Biquad.cpp#233)

----

### `(wa.)lowshelf2`

Standard second-order lowshelf filter.
Frequencies lower than the frequency get a boost, or an attenuation, frequencies over it are unchanged.

```
_ : lowshelf2(f0, gain, dtune) : _
```

Where:

* `f0`: cutoff frequency in Hz
* `gain`: the gain in dB
* `dtune`: detuning of the frequency in cents

#### Reference

* [https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/webaudio/blink/Biquad.cpp#169](https://searchfox.org/mozilla-central/source/dom/media/webaudio/blink/Biquad.cpp#169)

----

### `(wa.)highshelf2`

Standard second-order highshelf filter.
Frequencies higher than the frequency get a boost or an attenuation, frequencies lower than it are unchanged.

```
_ : highshelf2(f0, gain, dtune) : _
```

Where:

* `f0`: cutoff frequency in Hz
* `gain`: the gain in dB
* `dtune`: detuning of the frequency in cents
